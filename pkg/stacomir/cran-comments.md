## NEWS 0.6.0

stacomir based on gwidget was dropped from CRAN in May 2020, it has been completely reprogrammed to remove all dependence to
gwidget and the graphical interface will be a new shiny package (under developpement). Stacomirtools has been rewritten and submitted to CRAN 
to connect via pool and DBI.

* added import to package  `rlang` 
* Change to adapt to new dplyr format `dplyr:n()` instead of `n()` see dplyr breaking change in version 1.0.0
* adapted to stacomirtools new connection and connection options (using pool and DBI instead of RODC)
* removed all dependency to gwidgetRGTK2 so in practise there is no longer a graphical interface, the shiny package is due soon.
* added code of conduct
* rewrote unit tests increased coverage from 50 to 78 %
