## stacomirtools 0.6.0

stacomir based on gwidget was dropped from CRAN in May 2020, it will soon switch
to only command line interface (reprogrammed to remove all dependence to
gwidget) and the graphical interface will be a new shiny package. So basically
we need to add connection class that work in LINUX in stacomirtools.

* Rewrote classes for connections using DBI and pool.
* The connection settings can now be made using options.
* Added unit tests to all classes.
* now documented using Roxygen.
* Connector classes using RODBC are now marked as deprecated and will fire note
  deprecated.
